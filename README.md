#W3C DOMCORE Errors#

Provides the **DOMException** and **DOMError** W3C interfaces from the section 3 (Errors) of the **DOM4** akka **DOMCore** W3C Working Draft

This is useful if you want to provide standard Errors in your own APIs or in Polyfill libraries

##How to use##


```
var DOMException = require('w3c-domcore-errors').DOMException;
var InvalidCharacterError = new DOMException('InvalidCharacterError');

function myStringHandler(data) {
    if (!REGEX_VALID_STRING.test(data)) {
        throw InvalidCharacterError;
    }
    // do the job
}
```
